## What is Gitbook ?

**GitBook** is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs.

We want to help **teams to work more efficiently**ü§ùby creating a simple but yet powerful service for them to **share their knowledge**.

The essence of the usage of Gitbook for the organization is to be a source of information for our various apps and libraries. Such that anyone in the organization can easily open and view documentations and support for different applications or libraries used by the tech team and/or organization.

This documentation was compiled by the Research & Development Team.
