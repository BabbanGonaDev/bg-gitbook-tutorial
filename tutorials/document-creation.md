# Document Creation

## Overview

In Gitbook, documentation projects are managed using a "repository" manner \(similar to Github\). Each documentation project is called **a space.**

These spaces can be stored primarily alone on Gitbook, or can be synchronized with a repository on Github. But for the purpose of technical documentations in Babbangona, **every documentation must be tied to its corresponding repository on Github.** A tutorial on integrating our Github repositories with their Gitbook spaces can be found [here](github-integration.md)

## How to create a space in Gitbook

### Step 1:

On the account dashboard, click on "Create a space" to get started.

### Step 3:

If successful, you would be redirected to the edit page of the newly created space \(or documentation project\).

Voila.... You have successfully created a space. ðŸŽ‰
