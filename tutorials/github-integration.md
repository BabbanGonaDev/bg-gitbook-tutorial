# Github Integration

## Overview

**Every Gitbook space \(documentation project\) is to be synchronized with its corresponding Github repository** so as to ensure that the documentation is **continuosly tracked** with its codebase and can be easily edited in **little bits as the codebase changes,** as opposed to large chunks of documentation creation or editing.

## How to integrate a space to Gitbook

### Step 1:

Create a repository on GitHub for the codebase, if one doesn't already exist.

### Step 2:

On the product dashboard, click on the "Integrations" tab and select the GitHub toggle

### Step 3: 

Specify the type of repositories to be displayed for you to select from. Due to the nature of sensitive credentials or details which are sometimes used or contained in our codebases. **Kindly click on "List all repositories"** in order to list **both private and public repositories** accessible to your GitHub credentials.
